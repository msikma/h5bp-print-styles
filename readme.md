# [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com) – Print styles

This is a repository containing only the print styles of the
[HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com) project. This was separated
from the project so that it could be separately published on NPM for use
in other CSS projects.

The main project is not published on NPM by the authors because it's
boilerplate code, and not a framework. Still, this CSS code makes for
a very decent print styles module.

Please see the [https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate](html5-boilerplate)
project on Github for more information.
